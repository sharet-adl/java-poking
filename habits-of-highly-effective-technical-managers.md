Habits of highly effective technical managers

12 be adaptive, not reactive            : not give in to pressure, be realistic, sw dev like surfing; agile is not scrum, feedback driven development. Adaptive planning (plan vs planning) = agile development
11 use carrots instead of sticks        : most use TDD extensively ( Threat Driven Dev :) ). Seek better results through motivation and support. 
10 match position with personality      : dont' try to fit person into position
 9 results, not presence                : right attitude, can you get the work done;
 8 work smart, not long/hard            : 'no one  will take this work away from you', rasor sharp-focus, 5PM; pair-programming
 7 address problems, dont' affix blame  : not them vs. us, words matter; one team mentality
 6 facilitate change                    : keen on sustainable ( bad: scrum master, velocity ); coach/plan/commit, bring support
 5 prefer alignment over agreement      : focus on why/where (final goal) we are heading
 4 do not play politics                 : people wine about others, but focus on outcome
 3 trully care about quality            : hard to catch up, deterioration is expo;
 2 stay technical                       : better able to assess risk, schedule, estimates, keep an eye on quality
 1 ask and understand why ?             : trust but verify; ask the team to justify decisions.
